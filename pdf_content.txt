T-Rex Technical Architecture
Overview

1. T-Rex Chain Layer Technical Architecture
The T-Rex Chain is an innovative Layer 2 (L2) solution designed to enhance the scalability,
security, and interoperability of the Ethereum ecosystem. Built as an EVM-compatible
Optimistic Rollup, it processes transactions off-chain and assumes they are valid by
default. This allows for massive scaling and low transaction costs. Fraud proofs are used
to identify and challenge invalid transactions within a specific window, ensuring that the
chain remains secure by inheriting the robust security of the Ethereum mainnet. Our
architecture is designed to be fully decentralized from the ground up, ensuring resilience
and censorship resistance.
Core Components of the T-Rex Chain:
● Execution Layer (EVM-compatible Optimistic Rollup): Our execution environment is a
high-performance Optimistic Rollup that processes transactions off-chain. This
allows for massive scaling, processing thousands of transactions per second (TPS)
while submitting a single, concise proof to the Ethereum mainnet. The EVM-
compatible design ensures seamless migration and development for existing Ethereum
dApps and smart contracts.
● Sequencer Layer (Decentralized): Unlike centralized L2s, the T-Rex Chain employs a
decentralized network of sequencers. These nodes are responsible for collecting,
ordering, and batching transactions into blocks. This decentralized approach prevents
single points of failure, mitigates front-running and MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)
risks, and ensures the network remains permissionless and robust. Sequencers are
selected and rewarded through a transparent, on-chain mechanism.
● Data Availability Layer (Decentralized): Transaction data is published to a
decentralized data availability (DA) layer to ensure that any network participant can
reconstruct the full state of the T-Rex Chain. This is a crucial security feature that
allows for permissionless state validation and enables fast withdrawals. By separating
data publication from transaction execution, we significantly reduce the costs of data
storage and further enhance scalability.

2. 5D T-Rex Persona Ecosystem Technical
Architecture
The 5D T-Rex Persona Ecosystem is a multi-faceted system designed to transform a
static on-chain identity into a dynamic, multi-dimensional digital persona.
2.1 T-Rex Passport: The Universal On-Chain DID
The T-Rex Passport is a singular, on-chain Decentralized Identifier (DID) for each user. It
is a publicly visible smart contract that serves as the nexus of a user's digital life. Users
can link multiple wallet addresses from various blockchain ecosystems, including EVM-
compatible chains (like Ethereum, Polygon) and Solana. The T-Rex Passport also supports
the binding of Web2 social accounts, creating a comprehensive and interoperable identity.
2.2 T-Rex Badge System: A Comprehensive Validation Engine
The T-Rex Badge System is a publicly visible, smart contract-based ecosystem that
validates and mints badges based on a user's on-chain and off-chain activities. The
system leverages three core types of validators:
On-Chain Data Validators This suite of validators analyzes a user's on-chain data across
multiple networks to verify credentials.
● NFT Validator: Supports both ERC-721 and ERC-1155 data standards. It allows for the
flexible configuration of validation conditions based on a user's NFT metadata,
transfer history, holding duration, and DeFi transaction behavior. This enables the
creation of badges for NFT collectors and digital art enthusiasts.
● Token Validator: This validator supports assets on Ethereum, EVM-compatible chains,
and Solana. It provides a robust framework to create validation conditions based on a
user's wallet balances, transaction history, and asset holding duration. This is
essential for recognizing a user's financial contributions and stability.
● Web3 Validator: This validator tracks specific, verifiable on-chain behaviors, such as a
user's interactions with designated smart contracts. It's a powerful tool for rewarding
protocol participation and dApp usage.
ZKTLS Validator
In deep collaboration with the Reclaim Protocol, the T-Rex Extension allows users to
privately verify their Web2 assets and identities using Zero-Knowledge and TLS proofs.
This validator enables the creation of badges based on a wide range of sensitive data
without revealing the underlying information. Validated credentials include:
● Financial Standing: CEX total assets, CEX VIP levels.
● Social Influence: Follower counts on TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitch;
Instagram "Bluetick" verification.
● Digital Presence: YouTube subscriber count, GitHub stars.
● Membership & Subscriptions: Premium memberships for Telegram, ChatGPT, Gemini,
Grok, Perplexity, Claude, PS Plus, Xbox Game Pass, Nintendo Switch Online, Spotify,
YouTube, Apple Music, Netflix, and Amazon Prime; Steam game ownership count.
Ecosystem Validator
This validator is designed to reward user participation within the T-Rex ecosystem itself. It
facilitates the creation of badges for:
● Early Bird Badges: Rewards for early adopters.
● Event Badges: Recognizes participation in specific events, such as the "Asia Tour."
● Student Identity Verification: Allows for the verification of student status for
educational incentives.
● Eligible Validators: Customizable validators for tasks like determining multi-stage NFT
minting eligibility.
Social Validator
This system supports a range of Web2 social media interactions, from simply linking a
social account to a T-Rex Passport to tracking specific behaviors like follows and posts,
providing a holistic view of a user's social footprint.
2.3 Ecosystem Points
Ecosystem Points are a centrally stored asset within the T-Rex Passport. They are
designed to be a direct reflection of a user's engagement and activity within the
ecosystem.
● Each badge minted has a corresponding point value.
● Different social tasks also have specific point values.
● This comprehensive user point and task system provides a dynamic metric for user
activity, engagement, and contribution, serving as a secondary asset class within the
T-Rex Passport.
3. Open Ecosystem
The T-Rex ecosystem is designed to be open and interoperable, with a focus on
empowering DApp developers and projects.
● Smart Contracts: Our relevant contracts will be made public and verified, allowing for
full transparency and audibility.

4. The Economic Symbiosis Engine: Unlocking a New
Web3 Paradigm
The T-Rex Passport, a living digital identity, is composed of a vast, multi-dimensional
dataset including on-chain badges and off-chain points. This data represents a user's
unique journey and interactions across the web. The T-Rex Economic Symbiosis Engine, a
sophisticated backend system, is designed to transform this raw data into actionable
insights, creating a powerful User Data Magic experience that benefits both users and
projects.
The Technical Foundation: Big Data, AI, and BI
Our economic symbiosis engine is built on a robust technical stack that integrates three
key components:
● Big Data: We process and store a massive volume of user behavioral data,
encompassing on-chain activities (transaction history, asset holdings, dApp
interactions) and off-chain proofs (Web2 social and membership data from ZKTLS
validators). This data lake provides a comprehensive view of a user's digital footprint.
● Artificial Intelligence (AI): Machine learning models are the core of our engine. They
analyze the collected data to build a detailed and dynamic user persona graph. This
graph goes beyond simple data points, identifying patterns, interests, and potential
future behaviors. For example, a model might predict a user's interest in a new
GameFi launch based on their NFT holdings, Steam game library, and activity in
similar protocols.
● Business Intelligence (BI): The AI-generated insights are then presented through a
Business Intelligence layer. DApps and projects can access a user-friendly dashboard
to define their ideal user profile using a simple query language. For example, a project
could search for "users with high DeFi activity AND a CEX VIP Level > 3 AND a 'Social
Validator' badge for Twitch followers > 10,000." This BI layer translates complex data
into simple, actionable strategies.
Technical Architecture of the Engine
The Economic Symbiosis Engine is architected as a microservices-based, event-driven
system to ensure scalability, flexibility, and real-time processing of user data.
1. Data Ingestion Layer: This layer is responsible for collecting data from various
sources:
○ On-Chain Listeners: Real-time listeners monitor T-Rex Passport and Badge
contracts for new mints, updates, and on-chain interactions.
○ Off-Chain API Gateways: Secure, private gateways receive data from our ZKTLS
and Social Validators.
○ Batch Processors: Historical on-chain data is periodically ingested to build initial
user profiles.
2. Data Processing Pipeline: Once ingested, data flows through a pipeline of services for
cleaning, normalization, and transformation into a unified format. This pipeline is built
using a pub/sub model to handle high throughput and ensure data integrity.
3. User Persona Graph Service: This is the core of our AI component. It's a graph
database that stores the user personas, their relationships to different badges, and
the associated data points. Our AI models continuously update this graph based on
new data and behavioral patterns.
4. Matching & Ranking Service: This service executes the Persona Matching Score (PMS)
algorithm. It takes a project's criteria as input, queries the User Persona Graph
Service, and returns a ranked list of users based on their computed PMS. This service
is optimized for low-latency queries to support real-time marketing applications.
5. BI & Analytics Layer: A set of APIs and dashboards that allow projects to interact with
the Matching & Ranking Service and visualize user data. This layer provides tools for
cohort analysis, A/B testing, and campaign performance tracking.
The Dual-Benefit Ecosystem: A New Economic Model
The T-Rex Economic Symbiosis Engine creates a symbiotic relationship, fostering a two-
way benefit model that fundamentally changes economic efficiency in Web3.
For the User:
The engine acts as a self-discovery tool. By interacting with the T-Rex ecosystem, users
accumulate badges and points that paint a complete, verifiable picture of their digital self.
They can use the T-Rex Passport as a personal BI dashboard to understand their own
history, asset composition, and contributions. Instead of passively waiting for opportunities,
they are proactively matched with projects and communities that align with their interests,
skills, and values.
For the Project:
Projects can move beyond broad, expensive, and inefficient marketing campaigns. The
engine allows for precision targeting, enabling them to find and engage with their most
valuable users at a fraction of the cost. The data-driven insights eliminate guesswork,
ensuring that every marketing dollar and community effort is spent on users who are most
likely to be genuinely interested and become long-term contributors. This creates a highly
efficient, high-conversion marketing channel.
The Algorithm: A Simple Look
At the core of the Economic Symbiosis Engine is a Persona Matching Score (PMS), a
metric that quantifies the alignment between a user's persona and a project's target
profile. The formula is:
Where:
● n is the number of defined criteria by the project.
● wi​ is the weight assigned to each criterion i (e.g., a project might weigh "DeFi
activity" more than "Twitch followers").
● V(Ci​ ) is a value function that evaluates a user's data against criterion i. This
function can be a simple binary (0 or 1), a scaled value (0-100), or a logarithmic
function for non-linear data like follower counts.
The engine then returns a list of T-Rex Passport holders ranked by their PMS, enabling
projects to conduct highly precise, on-chain marketing and engagement. This innovative
system breaks the traditional marketing "impossible trinity," proving that efficiency,
precision, and user value can all be achieved simultaneously.
