# Relayers

Relayer services enable cross-chain message passing and communication between T-Rex Chain and other blockchain networks.

## Overview

Relayers are infrastructure services that facilitate:

- **Cross-Chain Messages**: Send messages between chains
- **State Synchronization**: Keep state consistent across chains
- **Event Propagation**: Relay events from one chain to another
- **Data Availability**: Ensure data is available across chains

## How Relayers Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Message Origination">
    A message is created on the source chain
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Relayer Detection">
    Relayers monitor and detect the message
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verification">
    Relayers verify the message validity
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Delivery">
    Message is delivered to the destination chain
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirmation">
    Transaction is confirmed on the destination chain
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Relayer Types

### Official Relayers

T-Rex provides official relayers for core cross-chain functionality:

- **Bridge Relayers**: Relay bridge transactions
- **State Relayers**: Relay state updates
- **Event Relayers**: Relay contract events

### Decentralized Relayers

Community-operated relayers provide additional options:

- **Permissionless Operation**: Anyone can run a relayer
- **Incentivized**: Rewards for successful relays
- **Redundant**: Multiple relayers ensure reliability

### Third-Party Relayers

Third-party services may offer specialized relayer services:

- **Enterprise Relayers**: High-availability relayer services
- **Custom Relayers**: Specialized relay solutions
- **Multi-Chain Relayers**: Support for multiple chains

## Use Cases

### Cross-Chain Applications

- Send messages between chains
- Synchronize state across networks
- Enable cross-chain composability

### Bridge Operations

- Relay bridge transactions
- Verify cross-chain transfers
- Maintain bridge state

### Event Broadcasting

- Propagate events across chains
- Enable cross-chain notifications
- Support multi-chain applications

## Running Your Own Relayer

### Requirements

- Node infrastructure
- RPC access to source and destination chains
- Monitoring and alerting systems

### Setup

```bash
# Clone relayer repository
git clone https://github.com/trex-network/relayer.git
cd relayer

# Configure relayer
cp config.example.toml config.toml
# Edit config.toml with your settings

# Start relayer
./relayer --config config.toml
```

### Configuration

Relayer configuration includes:

- Source and destination chain RPC endpoints
- Message filters and routing rules
- Gas price and fee settings
- Monitoring and logging options

<Tip>
Running a relayer can be profitable through fees and incentives, while also supporting the T-Rex ecosystem.
