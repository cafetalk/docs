# Deployed Contracts

This document lists all deployed system contracts and important contract addresses on T-Rex Chain.

## System Contracts

### Mainnet Contract Addresses

| Contract Name | Address | Description |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
| T-Rex Passport | `0xbbB216C52f5B9095391f463AdC438d65a8aC2242` | Universal on-chain DID for users |
| T-Rex Badge | `0x6F52cCCfAb0712Db45C31863B262e2683097bb5c` | Badge validation and minting system |

### Testnet Contract Addresses

| Contract Name | Address | Description |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
| T-Rex Passport | `0x06fAb5a4e177fefE5Cc15dc41C64Ba933021418a` | Universal on-chain DID for users |
| T-Rex Badge | `0xa51B53Dc3aA7f4ef5fE9bb429521a73f411ad867` | Badge validation and minting system |

## Contract Verification

All system contracts are verified and publicly auditable. You can view the source code on the block explorer:

## Interacting with Contracts

### Using Block Explorer

1. Visit the [block explorer](https://explorer.trex.xyz/)
2. Search for the contract address
3. View contract details and ABI
4. Interact directly with the contract

### Using Code

```javascript
const { ethers } = require('ethers');

const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://rpc.trex.xyz/');

// T-Rex Passport
const passportAddress = '0xbbB216C52f5B9095391f463AdC438d65a8aC2242';
const passportABI = [/* ABI */];

const passport = new ethers.Contract(passportAddress, passportABI, provider);

// Get linked wallets
const wallets = await passport.getLinkedWallets(userAddress);

// T-Rex Badge
const badgeAddress = '0x6F52cCCfAb0712Db45C31863B262e2683097bb5c';
const badgeABI = [/* ABI */];

const badge = new ethers.Contract(badgeAddress, badgeABI, provider);

// Check user badges
const hasBadge = await badge.hasBadge(userAddress, badgeId);
```

## Contract ABIs

Contract ABIs are available:

- On the block explorer (for verified contracts)
- In the [T-Rex SDKs](/documentation/build-on-trex/applications)
- In the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/trex-network)

## Open Source

All system contracts are:

- **Open Source**: Source code available on GitHub
- **Verified**: Verified on the block explorer
- **Auditable**: Fully auditable and transparent

<Tip>
Use the [T-Rex SDKs](/documentation/build-on-trex/applications) for easier integration instead of interacting with contracts directly.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Always verify contract addresses before interacting with them. Double-check against the official documentation.
</Warning>
