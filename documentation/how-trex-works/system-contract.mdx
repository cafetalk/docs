# System Contracts

T-Rex Chain includes several system contracts that provide core functionality for the network and ecosystem.

## T-Rex Passport Contract

The T-Rex Passport is a universal on-chain Decentralized Identifier (DID) for each user. It is a publicly visible smart contract that serves as the nexus of a user's digital life.

### Contract Addresses

| Network | Address |
|---------|---------|
| Mainnet | `0xbbB216C52f5B9095391f463AdC438d65a8aC2242` |
| Testnet | `0x06fAb5a4e177fefE5Cc15dc41C64Ba933021418a` |

### Key Features

- **Multi-Wallet Linking**: Links multiple wallet addresses from EVM chains and Solana
- **Web2 Social Binding**: Binds Web2 social accounts for comprehensive identity
- **Public Visibility**: All passport data is publicly visible on-chain
- **Interoperable**: Designed for cross-chain and cross-platform compatibility

### Interface

```solidity
interface ITRexPassport {
    function linkWallet(address wallet) external;
    function unlinkWallet(address wallet) external;
    function linkSocialAccount(string memory platform, string memory accountId) external;
    function getLinkedWallets(address user) external view returns (address[] memory);
    function getSocialAccounts(address user) external view returns (SocialAccount[] memory);
}
```

## T-Rex Badge Contract

The T-Rex Badge System is a publicly visible, smart contract-based ecosystem that validates and mints badges based on a user's on-chain and off-chain activities.

### Contract Addresses

| Network | Address |
|---------|---------|
| Mainnet | `0x6F52cCCfAb0712Db45C31863B262e2683097bb5c` |
| Testnet | `0xa51B53Dc3aA7f4ef5fE9bb429521a73f411ad867` |

### Badge Validators

The system leverages multiple types of validators:

#### On-Chain Data Validators

- **NFT Validator**: Supports ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards
  - Validates NFT metadata, transfer history, holding duration
  - Tracks DeFi transaction behavior
  
- **Token Validator**: Supports Ethereum, EVM chains, and Solana
  - Validates wallet balances and transaction history
  - Tracks asset holding duration
  
- **Web3 Validator**: Tracks verifiable on-chain behaviors
  - Monitors interactions with designated smart contracts
  - Rewards protocol participation

#### ZKTLS Validator

In collaboration with Reclaim Protocol, enables private verification of Web2 assets:

- Financial standing (CEX assets, VIP levels)
- Social influence (follower counts, verification status)
- Digital presence (subscriber counts, GitHub stars)
- Memberships and subscriptions

#### Ecosystem Validator

Rewards participation within the T-Rex ecosystem:

- Early Bird Badges
- Event Badges
- Student Identity Verification
- Custom eligibility validators

#### Social Validator

Tracks Web2 social media interactions:

- Account linking
- Follow behavior
- Post activity

### Interface

```solidity
interface ITRexBadge {
    function mintBadge(address user, uint256 badgeId) external;
    function hasBadge(address user, uint256 badgeId) external view returns (bool);
    function getUserBadges(address user) external view returns (uint256[] memory);
    function createBadge(BadgeMetadata memory metadata) external returns (uint256);
}
```

## Ecosystem Points

Ecosystem Points are centrally stored within the T-Rex Passport:

- **Badge-Based Points**: Each badge has a corresponding point value
- **Social Task Points**: Different social tasks have specific point values
- **Dynamic Metric**: Reflects user activity, engagement, and contribution
- **Secondary Asset**: Serves as a secondary asset class within the Passport

## Contract Verification

All system contracts are verified and publicly auditable:

## Integration

### Using the Contracts

```javascript
const { ethers } = require('ethers');

const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://rpc.trex.xyz/');

// T-Rex Passport
const passportAddress = '0xbbB216C52f5B9095391f463AdC438d65a8aC2242';
const passportABI = [/* ABI */];
const passport = new ethers.Contract(passportAddress, passportABI, provider);

// Check linked wallets
const wallets = await passport.getLinkedWallets(userAddress);

// T-Rex Badge
const badgeAddress = '0x6F52cCCfAb0712Db45C31863B262e2683097bb5c';
const badgeABI = [/* ABI */];
const badge = new ethers.Contract(badgeAddress, badgeABI, provider);

// Check user badges
const hasBadge = await badge.hasBadge(userAddress, badgeId);
const badges = await badge.getUserBadges(userAddress);
```

## Open Ecosystem

T-Rex ecosystem is designed to be open and interoperable:

- **Public Contracts**: All relevant contracts are public and verified
- **Open SDKs**: Comprehensive SDKs for easy integration
- **Transparency**: Full transparency and audibility

<Tip>
Use the [T-Rex SDKs](/documentation/build-on-trex/applications) for easier integration instead of interacting with contracts directly.
