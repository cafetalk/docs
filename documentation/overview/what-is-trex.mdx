# What is T-Rex?

T-Rex is a next-generation blockchain platform that combines a high-performance Layer 2 solution with a revolutionary multi-dimensional identity system. T-Rex is reshaping value distribution for the Web3 economy through precision matching and intelligent engagement.

## T-Rex Chain: The Foundation

T-Rex Chain is an **EVM-compatible Optimistic Rollup** that provides:

- **Massive Scaling**: Processes thousands of transactions per second
- **Low Costs**: Significantly reduced transaction fees compared to Ethereum mainnet
- **EVM Compatibility**: Seamless migration for existing dApps and smart contracts
- **Decentralized Architecture**: Fully decentralized sequencer and data availability layers

## 5D T-Rex Persona Ecosystem

The 5D Persona Ecosystem transforms static on-chain identities into dynamic, multi-dimensional digital personas:

### T-Rex Passport

A universal on-chain Decentralized Identifier (DID) that serves as the nexus of a user's digital life:

- Links multiple wallet addresses across EVM chains and Solana
- Binds Web2 social accounts for comprehensive identity
- Publicly visible smart contract for transparency and interoperability

### T-Rex Badge System

A comprehensive validation engine that mints badges based on user activities:

- **On-Chain Validators**: NFT, Token, and Web3 activity validation
- **ZKTLS Validator**: Private verification of Web2 assets and identities
- **Ecosystem Validator**: Rewards for participation in T-Rex ecosystem
- **Social Validator**: Tracks Web2 social media interactions

### Ecosystem Points

A centrally stored asset reflecting user engagement:

- Badge-based point values
- Social task rewards
- Dynamic metric for activity and contribution

## Economic Symbiosis Engine

The Economic Symbiosis Engine creates a symbiotic relationship between users and projects:

- **For Users**: Self-discovery tool that matches them with aligned projects and communities
- **For Projects**: Precision targeting for efficient, high-conversion marketing
- **AI-Powered**: Uses machine learning to build detailed user persona graphs
- **Business Intelligence**: User-friendly dashboard for defining ideal user profiles

## Why T-Rex?

T-Rex solves fundamental economic inefficiencies in Web3:

1. **Precision Matching**: Connect users with projects that align with their interests
2. **Verifiable Credentials**: Multi-dimensional identity with on-chain and off-chain proofs
3. **Cost Efficiency**: Low transaction costs with high throughput
4. **Open Ecosystem**: Transparent contracts and open SDKs for developers

<Warning>
T-Rex is currently in mainnet. Make sure to use the correct network configuration when connecting.
